<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

<p>First, we'll create a role named 'Supreme Admin.' In osTicket, roles define the permissions assigned to Agents, determining their access level within each Department they are part of. This foundational step ensures structured access control from the outset.</p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
Ensure you are in the Admin Panel, where you can access essential configuration and management settings.</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
Select all permission boxes for the 'Supreme Admin' role to grant full access.</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
Under 'Tickets' > 'Tasks', check all boxes to enable complete access.</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
In the 'Tickets' > 'Tasks' > 'Knowledgebase' section, ensure all boxes are checked for full privileges.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jNqtmL7.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
Confirm that the new role has been successfully added to the panel.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0elZtnW.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
To add a new department, navigate to 'Agents' > 'Departments' > 'Add New Department'.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cjiPJOO.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
Tickets are directed through various departments within the help desk, each of which can be customized with its own set of settings.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jj8Dfub.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
A new department named 'System Administrators' has been added.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HirGRt3.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
Teams enable grouping of Agents from various Departments to address specific issues or users, organized through Help Topics or Ticket Filters. Navigate to 'Agents' > 'Teams' > 'Add New Team' to create one.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cXAdRac.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
Enter the necessary details for the team.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/I1zQPbB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
To add Agents to the team, click on their names from the Agent list and click on 'Create Team'.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YhNNTkm.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
Enable ticket creation by anyone by going to 'Settings' > 'Users'.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NLJkcDB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
Ensure the option 'Require registration and login to create tickets' is unchecked.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xtczToC.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
Next, we'll set up agents with access to the help desk, tasked with responding to and resolving tickets.</p>
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yCoKXqL.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>Navigate to 'Agents' > 'Add New Agent' to proceed.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
Create an agent named 'Jane Doe' and establish a password for her account.<p>

</p>
<br />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ya0dQoF.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
Assign department and role access to agents as needed.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EeIzwD5.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
We can also assign the agent to a team that was previously created.</p>

</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nprHnpt.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
Another agent named John Doe was also created.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HsxSEOF.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
"Next, we'll add users to our directory. Users can register an account to submit tickets and monitor their status.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PhHCtqh.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5hobfZn.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
Verify that the new user, Karen Kim, has been added to the user directory.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5zjSeyX.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
Now, let's proceed to set up the Service Level Agreement (SLA).</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/T2d02Kp.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p> Navigate to 'Admin Panel' > 'Manage' > 'SLA Plans' and select 'Add New SLA Plan'.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Fuwxibl.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
In osTicket, you can create unlimited SLA Plans. These plans define the expected timeframe for resolving tickets, as set by the help desk administrator.</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3P4jOEu.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>
We've established three SLA plans, each with different severity levels and response times. 
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/pIH3ULS.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>Next, let's set up the help topics. Navigate to Manage > Help Topics in the Admin Panel and select 'Add New Help Topic'.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4FXCmkp.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<br />

<p>For this exercise, let's create four additional help topics: Business Critical Outage, Personal, Computer Issues, Equipment Request, and Password Reset.</p>
<p>

<br />

<p>As we conclude this lab, we've laid the groundwork for our support system. In the upcoming lab, we'll delve into creating, triaging, and resolving tickets, applying what we've built so far.</p>
