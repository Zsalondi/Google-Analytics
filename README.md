<h2>Scenario</h2>

As a new marketing associate at Google, you have been asked to familiarize yourself with the metrics in Google Analytics that are available for the Google Merchandise Store. To help you do this, your manager has given you a list of metrics for user acquisition, engagement, and monetization that you can view under the Life cycle section of the tool. Normally, someone reviews these metrics on a monthly basis. Since this has been incorporated into your training assignment, everyone on the team is thrilled that you’ll be helping to get some real work done!

<h2>Step 3: Find Acquisition metrics</h2>
<p>
Next find the total number of new users and the number and percentage of new users who arrive at the Google Merchandise Store after using these search engines:
<ul>
  <li>Google</li>
  <li>Bing</li>
  <li>YouTube</li>
  <li>Baidu</li>
</ul></p>
<br />

<p> Browse the data under Life cycle > Acquisition to find where you can locate the search information, and record the total new users and number of new users for each search engine. </p>

</p>
<br />

<h2>Step 4: Find Engagement metrics</h2>
<p>
The manager asked for the total users for the following events:
<ul>
  <li>session_start</li>
  <li>begin_checkout</li>
  <li>remove_from_cart</li>
  <li>purchase</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Browse the data under Life cycle > Engagement to find each of the events, and record the values for total users. Also, calculate and record the following as insights for your manager:
<ul>
<b>Number of users with cart abandonment = </b>
<li>(total users for begin_checkout) − (total users for purchase)</li> <br />
<b>Sales conversion rate =</b> 
<li>[(total users for purchase) / (session_start)] x 100 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<br />

<p>Use the drop-down for Rows per page and select 50 so you can view all the events on a single page.</p>
